Once again, the cryptocurrency market is booming.

Take Bitcoin, the Granddaddy of the crypto world. After rising more than 400% in 2020, Bitcoin has nearly doubled in 2021, peaking at almost $65,000 in early April. In other words - if you had purchased $1000 worth of Bitcoin in March of 2020, it would be worth more than $10,000 today. An ROI fit to make hedge fund investors drool.

Not to be outdone, Ethereum - the cool, techy uncle in this metaphor - grew from a low of $130 on January 1, 2020 to over $4100 in May 2021. That's a 3100% increase, enough to turn a relatively modest $3200 investment into a million dollar holding.
