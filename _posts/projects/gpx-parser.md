A lightweight React application that accepts a .gpx file and outputs a map (custom design via Google Maps Javascript API), an elevation graph, a pace chart, and split times, along with statistics for each chart. Bootstrapped with create-react-app and styled with styled-components on top of a Bootstrap grid system.
