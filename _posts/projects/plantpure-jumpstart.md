I completed this project while employed at PlantPure, Inc., a plant-based foods and education company.

Our flagship education program is the **PlantPure Jumpstart** a 10-day immersion experience that teaches participants the fundamentals of living plant-based. This immersion program was used during the filming of *PlantPure Nation* and is well known in the plant-based space.

In the summer of 2020 we decided to completely revamp the Jumpstart program. Much of the video content was either updated or replaced; the format of the course changed from an in-person group experience to an online course through the Teachable platform; and the program now included a movie, DVD and cookbook along with the standard education package.

I was asked to design a logo for the revamped program. The ideals that the logo was to depict were:

- Cleanliness
- Simplicity
- Authenticity

The logo also had to fit in with our current design system.

I decided to design around the idea of a seal (you know, like the old-timey wax ones used to secure an envelope's contents.) Rather than an amorphous wax smudge, however, I wanted something closer to a stamp of validity. This was, after all, ***the*** PlantPure Jumpstart.

The images below depicts my working progress.

In draft #1, I tried mimicking the font used in our main corporate logo. However, it quickly became apparent that that would be simply too much cursive and too long. Also, in most use cases, either the outer circle of the logo would either be laughably large, or the text within would be illegible. 

In draft #2, I dropped the full name of the program and replaced it with the initials that we often use to discuss the program internally: **JS**.

In draft #3, 

In draft #4, I realized that the white border would clash or blend incompletely with any whitish background.

Draft #4 is the final products. See color and theme variations below.
