          description: This keyboard was my first foray into the mechanical switch world, and I'll admit I had to force myself to use it at first. The build quality is top-notch - it has a sturdy aluminum body, keycaps with very little play, and the bluetooth almost never drops out. One of my pet peeves is cheap cables, so I was especially happy to find that the included USB-A USB-C cable was 1.8m long and braided, with a 90 degree connection to the board that reduces stress to the cord. However, after just one year of use several of the switches already feel 'dead' and the keycaps are showing their wear.

          description: I picked up this mouse after breaking my arm and having limited mobility, but have kept it since when I noticed some recurring popping and aches in my shoulders dissappeared. Ergonomically, it's fantastic, though the build quality is meh. It feels like a plastic shell filled with 90% air. The customizable buttons are a nice touch though.

          description: It's the industry standard for a reason. I love the plugin ecosystem and the fact that I can have a git GUI, terminal, text-editor, and even an HTTP client all in the same window.

          description: I played around with some of the new-age terminals like Hyper and Tabby, but found them actually more clunky than good ole iTerm.
